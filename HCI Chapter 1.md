# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction

## Definition of HCI
Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

## Common Terminiologies
- User-centered design
    - It is a product development methodology that consists of task-based business objectives and user-centric activities and analysis throughout the development cycle.
    - Designing interactive products to support people in everyday and working lives

- Interaction design
    - It is the art of facilitating interactions between human mediated by products

- Interactive systems
    - Interactive systems are things that deal with the transmission, display, storage or transformation of information that people can perceive.
        - Devices and systems that respond dynamically to people's actions
        - Interactive components are included in many products nowadays ("clothes, buildings and cameras...")

## Moore's Law

## Importance of Interface Design
- Computer systems affect every person
    - Effectiveness
    - Productivity
    - Morale
    - Safety

## How do we design good systems?
- No general or unified theory
- Issues of concern while considering design of interactive systems:
    - People
    - Technologies
    - Tasks
    - Design

## Professional Jobs
- Interaction designers
    - people involved in the design of all the interactive aspects of a product
- Usabililty engineers
    - people who focus on evaluating products, using usability methods and principles
- Web designers
    - people who develop and create the visual design of websites, such as layouts
- Information architects
    - people who come up with ideas of how to plan and structure interactive products
- User experience designers (UX)
    - people who do all the above but who may also carry out field studies to inform the design of products
